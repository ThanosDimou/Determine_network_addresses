# Determine_network_addresses
An easy Python way to calculate network/broadcast and host addresses. Through the Tkinter GUI, you just need to enter the client IP address and subnet mask in the required fields and use the "Calculate" button to display the Network/Broadcast address, the number of available clients the network can support as well as the addresses that clients can use.
